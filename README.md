The repo includes a python venv for Flask and Pyinstaller on **Windows**.
to launch the server you must activate the venv first like.

For Powershell:

```
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

For Command Prompt:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

And to start the server:

```
python server.py
```

Or build and run server.exe:

```
.\scripts\build-and-run.ps1
```

Then goto the address provided by the server, something like: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
